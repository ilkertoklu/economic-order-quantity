# EOQ Calculator

This program calculates the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and optimum order quantities for multiple stock items based on user input. EOQ is a formula used in inventory management to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total inventory costs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter module (usually included in Python standard library)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the program file is located.
4. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   python eoq_calculator.py
5. The EOQ Calculator window will appear.

## Usage
1. Enter the number of stock items (rows) in the table and the total stock area in the corresponding entry fields.
2. Click the "Hesapla" (Calculate) button.
3. For each stock item, a separate window will appear to enter the required data (unit cost, demand rate, holding cost, and storage area).
4. Enter the data for each stock item and click the "Kaydet" (Save) button.
5. After entering the data for all stock items, the program will calculate the optimum order quantity and display the results in the program window.
